                At Doexcess, we believe digital work shouldn&apos;t feel
                disorganized or overwhelming. We&apos;ve seen people experience
                the stress of juggling scattered tools, missing tasks, and
                managing important workflows with systems that simply
                didn&apos;t scale. So we decided to build something more
                efficient.

                At Doexcess, we&apos;re building a platform that helps
                individuals, teams, and organizations simplify tasks, reduce
                chaos, and stay organized — all in one place. We&apos;ve seen
                people experienced the stress of switching between tools,
                missing deadlines, and managing scattered workflows. So we
                created a smarter way to work. Doexcess is a system built to
                help you optimize how you work — with more clarity, more
                control, and less stress.

                It all started early 2024 when I began working on a project I
                initially called SkillUp. The idea was simple: make practical
                knowledge affordable and accessible to as many people as
                possible. But when I discovered the name was already taken, I
                rebranded it to Learnexcess and kept building—layer by layer.

                I&apos;ve always had a passion for creating things, especially
                tools that solve real problems. And over time, I noticed
                something: many creators were struggling to manage their digital
                offerings effectively. There were too many moving parts—too many
                tools that didn&apos;t quite fit together. That&apos;s when it
                hit me: "What if we build an all that can solve this specific
                problem?"... <ViewStoryModal />

                  Once I had the foundation set, I reached out to Tofunmi, who
                  believed in the vision and jumped in to help. Starting with
                  the logo design, Ben, a longtime friend, was also quick to get
                  on board, and soon after, Lynn joined the team too.

                  empowers creators, and puts cutting-edge technology into
